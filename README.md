### STEPS:

2) cd Inkredo
3) npm install
4) npm start

### TODO:

1) Make webapp responsinve and accessible
2) Write code in container pattern

### Notes:
1) Join company button will be only displayed if user is logged in
2) There might seem some issue with the behaviour with the web-app, but it's just because of the way I have mocked the response of API. In the normal flow, It would work fine. Giving a try to change the method was an option but It was little time-consuming.
3) There is limit of 200 requests per day. IF you face any issue, please contact me. I will fix it within 5 minutes.
