### LIVE APP: https://crwn-db-f6657.firebaseapp.com/

### STEPS:

1) clone repo using command: https://github.com/Dhara159/Inkredo.git
2) cd Inkredo
3) npm install
4) npm start

### TODO:

- [x] Add employee's history listing
- [x] Add Join/Leave functionality for an employee
- [x] Add Private route of employee dashboard
- [ ] Use Firebase database instead of mock API
- [ ] Add responsiveness and accesibility
- [ ] Write code in container pattern

### Notes:
1) Join company button will be only displayed if user is logged in
2) There might seem some issue with the behaviour with the web-app, but it's just because of the way I have mocked the response of API. In the normal flow, It would work fine. Giving a try to change the method was an option but It was little time-consuming.
3) There is limit of 200 requests per day. IF you face any issue, please contact me. I will fix it within 5 minutes.
